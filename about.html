            <h1 class="title"> About Me</h1>
            <p class="about-description"> My undergraduate path in computational and experimental chemistry has sparked a profound passion for merging theoretical models, including those enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) with the experimental. This passion has led me to explore diverse domains such as quantum computing and the sophisticated design of DNA origami, continually fueling my ambition to bridge theoretical insights with real-world implementations. </p>

            <p class="about-description"> At UBC BIOMOD, I played a key role in developing programs and experimental protocols that refine DNA origami structures, demonstrating the practical advantages of computational design. This initiative was pivotal in creating innovative DNA nanohinges, significantly boosting our teamâ€™s success at the BIOMOD Japan Open. Our collaborative efforts culminated in the co-authored pre-print, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.26.542516v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> "Self-Assembly of a Repeatable DNA Nanohinge System," </a> marking a significant milestone in my academic career. </p>

            <p class="about-description"> Finally, under Dr. Roman Krems's mentorship, my directed studies project offered valuable hands-on experience in integrating computational algorithms with experimental chemistry. This project focused on calculating ro-vibrational levels for diatomic molecules using simulated qubits, leading to the development of a Hamiltonian matrix in the DVR basis. This endeavor not only deepened my understanding of quantum computing's practical applications but also highlighted the critical role of theoretical predictions in advancing chemical research. </p>   
             <p class="about-description"> As of April 4, 2024, I have embarked on using Gaussian Processes to enhance hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, further advancing my research capabilities. </p>   
            <p> Throughout these experiences, I have evolved into a space where my efforts are marked by the development of empirically informed algorithms. This evolution reflects my commitment to innovative problem-solving and underscores my contribution to scientific advancement through data-driven research methodologies. My ultimate goal is to effect substantial change within the scientific community. I am committed to finding unique opportunities to advance my journey toward a future where computational and experimental methodologies are seamlessly integrated. Such integration promises not only to refine the research and processes that underpin our daily lives but also to deliver significant benefits to the community at large.  </p>
